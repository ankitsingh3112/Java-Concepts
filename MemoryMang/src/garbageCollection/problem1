Question: Suppose you go for the internship at GeeksForGeeks, 
and you were told to write a program to count the number of employees working in the company(excluding interns).
 To make this program, you have to use the concept of a garbage collector. 

This is the actual task you were given at the company:

Write a program to create a class called Employee having the following data members. 

1. An ID for storing unique id allocated to every employee. 
2. Name of employee. 
3. age of an employee.

Also, provide the following methods:

A parameterized constructor to initialize name and age. The ID should be initialized in this constructor.
A method show() to display ID, name, and age.
A method showNextId() to display the ID of the next employee.
